# Data Analysis | Measuring the Correlation between Military Expenditures and Distance between Capitals in Europe
# Introduction

In this notebook, I will briefly discuss a data analysis project that I intend to complete. I will just say a few words about it, trying to ennumerate my list of activities, the challenges I might face, and some conclusions about it.

# The context

Our subject of analysis is the **Russian-Ukranian war** and its effects on **military expenditures** of European countries. It is widely known that, as the war went on, governments have allocated larger sums to defense. We want to understand, however, if the amount that is allocated varies more or less depending on **how close/far countries are from Russia**. As such, we want to understand if this variable is relevant when trying to understand how military expenditures have varied across European countries recently.

# The problem

Our question is:

- Is the distance between city capitals and Moscow, the capital of Russia, a value correlated with **higher defense expenditures**, measured as % of GDP?


# Goals

By the end of this project, we expect to:

- Understand and measure this correlation
- Visualize the results in a Tableau presentation

# #TODO
